= Introduction =

Mycila Event is a new powerful event framework for in-memory event management. It has a lot of features similar to [https://eventbus.dev.java.net/ EventBus] but is better designed, uses Java Concurrency features and has a lot of more event features than EventBus, which are really useful when you work with a complex system driven by event messaging.

= Sample =

{{{
import static com.mycila.event.api.topic.Topics.*;

// first create an event service
EventService eventService = EventServices.newEventService();

// then subscribe
TopicMatcher matcher = only("app/events/swing/button").or(topics("app/events/swing/fields/**"));
eventService.subscribe(matcher, String.class, new HardSubscriber<String>() {
    @Override
    public void onEvent(Event<String> event) throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Received: " + event.source());
    }
});

// you can add a listener to oppose a veto to the events
eventService.register(only("app/events/swing/button"), String.class, new HardVetoer<String>() {
    @Override
    public void check(VetoableEvent<String> vetoableEvent) {
        if(vetoableEvent.event().source().equals("password"))
            vetoableEvent.veto();
    }
});

// and publish
eventService.publish(topic("app/events/swing/button"), "Hello !");
}}}

= Features =

== In-Memory event system ==

Mycila Event is not a JMS solution ! Like EventBus, Mycila Event resolves intra-process communication. In example, it can be used in a Swing GUI or in a complex modular framework to handle communication between plugins.

Thus, *Mycila Event must be fast, thread-safe and scalable.*

== Memory management == 

Like EventBus, Mycila Event supports *hard and weak subscriptions*. A hard subscription will always remain and must be unregistered if not needed anymore. A weak subscription will be automatically removed when the subscriber is no longer in use.

== Veto system ==

To control event publishing, you can register listeners to *intercept events before they are published*. If a veto is opposed, the event won't be published. You can oppose a veto simply by calling `vetoableEvent.veto()`.

{{{
eventService.register(only("app/events/swing/button"), MyEventType.class, new HardVetoer<String>() {
    @Override
    public void check(VetoableEvent<String> vetoableEvent) {
        [...]
        vetoableEvent.veto();
        [...]
    }
});
}}}

== Topic Matchers ==

enable a subscriber (and a vetoers) to subscribe to many topics

== Exception handling ==


== Asynchronous event dispatching ==

== Multicasting events ==

== Annotation support ==

you can annotate your methods to decouple your code from Mycila Event and subscribe, publish and veto
