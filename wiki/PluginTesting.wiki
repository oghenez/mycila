== Introduction ==

This plugin is always available since it is packaged in mycila-api. The plugin provides some annotations to control your test flow and improve Junit and TestNG assetions.

=== `@Skip` ===

All test methods annotated by @Skip will be skipped.

=== `@ExpectException` ===

Junit and TestNG already provide expected exception features, but they lack of attributes.

This annotation let you define complete assertions on exceptions like this:

{{{
    @Test
    @ExpectException(type = IllegalStateException.class, message = "exception 3")
    public void must_throw_an_exception_3() throws Exception {
        throw new IllegalStateException("exception 3");
    }

    @Test
    @ExpectException(type = IllegalStateException.class, containing = "4")
    public void must_throw_an_exception_4() throws Exception {
        throw new IllegalStateException("exception 4");
    }
}}}
