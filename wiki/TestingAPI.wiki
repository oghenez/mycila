= Mycila Testing API =

Mycila is composed of several APIs serving different users:
 * Those using Mycila testing framework on a day to day basis to write test,
 * Those writing test plugins
 * Those integrating Mycila in other test frameworks

== For Mycila users ==

You are lucky, you don't have to know anything except how to use the plugins you want to use and also which class to extend / use as a runner for your test:

 * `MycilaTestNGTest`
 * `MycilaJunit3Test`
 * `MycilaJunit4Test`
 * `@MycilaJunitRunner`

See corresponding entries on the left menu.

== For integration in test frameworks ==

To integrate Mycila in another testing framework, you can have a look on the [MycilaCustom integration wiki page].

== For Plugin writers ==
