= Mycila Testing API =

Mycila is composed of several APIs serving different users:
 * Those using Mycila testing framework on a day to day basis to write test,
 * Those writing test plugins
 * Those integrating Mycila in other test frameworks

== For Mycila users ==

You are lucky, you don't have to know anything except how to use the plugins you want to use and also which class to extend / use as a runner for your test:

 * `MycilaTestNGTest`
 * `MycilaJunit3Test`
 * `MycilaJunit4Test`
 * `@MycilaJunitRunner`

See corresponding entries on the left menu.

*Advanced usage*

If you want to configure the PluginManager (i.e. you only want to load for a test the PluginA), you will have to annotate your test with `@MycilaPlugins` and a method with `@ConfigureMycilaPlugins`.

Basically, `@MycilaPlugins` enables you to control which plugin descriptor to use (to isolate your plugin when testing) and this annotation enables you to configure per-test the PluginManager.

If you want to define your own plugin at runtime like [http://mycila.googlecode.com/svn/mycila-testing/trunk/mycila-testing-api/src/test/java/com/mycila/testing/junit/Junit4FlowTest.java this example], you'll have to annotate your configuration method with `@ConfigureMycilaPlugins`.

== For integration in test frameworks ==

To integrate Mycila in another testing framework, you can have a look on the [MycilaCustom integration wiki page].
