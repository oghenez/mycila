Mycila JMX is a simple but powerful library to export objects and connect to JMX. It has a powerful annotation support similar to spring, but does not depend on it and adds a lot of new features. Mycila JMX is a small library which can be integrated easily within Spring and Google Guice.

It is the best choice if you need a powerful annotation support like Spring but do not want to depend on it.

Also, Mycila JMX brings you several new features spring jmx does not have: 
 * a customizable exporter, to choose which field, property, operation to export
 * better annotation support, with a flexible control over what is exported
 * public field exporter: directly export all public members of any object, even if it is not an MBean
 * ability to export even non visible members
