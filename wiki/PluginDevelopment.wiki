Creating your own plugins for Mycila Testing Framework is very easy. As an example is better than many words, let's start by a tutorial on how to write a JMock Plugin.

=== First, What do we want for our plugin ? ===

 * Create and inject mock
 * Be able to access the mockery to verify expectations

We would like to be able to write tests using JMock like this:

{{{
public final class MyTest {

    @MockContext
    Mockery mockery;

    @Mock
    Service service;

    @BeforeClass
    public void setup() {
        TestSetup.setup(this);
    }

    @Test
    public void test_go() {
        mockery.checking(new Expectations() {{
            // some expectations
        }});
        // execute test
        mockery.assertIsSatisfied();
    }
}
}}}

 * *@Mock* defines a mock to create and inject
 * *MockContext* defines a place where to inject the mockery

=== Let's code ! ===

We need to have two annotations:
