== Introduction ==

Mycila Plugin Framework is a really little (4 classes) plugin framework that enables you to build quickly a plugin architecture in your application, supporting dependencies.

== Download ==

*mycila-plugin* is available
 * from the [http://code.google.com/p/mycila/downloads/list download section]
 * from our [http://code.google.com/p/mc-repo/ alternate maven repository]
 * and maybe (if deployed) in the central maven repository

== Maven dependency ==

To add mycila-plugin in your pom, just add this dependency (with of course the good version number your want):

{{{
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.code.mycila</groupId>
    <artifactId>mycila-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>X.Y</version>
</dependency>
}}}

We also provides a [http://code.google.com/p/jarjar/ JarJar] version packaged with [http://www.jgrapht.org/ JGraphT]. By using this version, you will have in one jar all the dependencies you need, and they won't clash with your jars.

{{{
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.code.mycila</groupId>
    <artifactId>mycila-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>X.Y</version>
    <classifier>full</classifier>
</dependency>
}}}
