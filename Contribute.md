Mycila Framework is very extensible. Contributions to add more plugins to the framework are greatly appreciated.

  * If you need to develop a specific plugin not yet listed
  * If you would like to implement one of the listed TODOs
  * If you find bugs, want to report a patch
  * Or if you want to simply post / comment

You can either post on the [Mycila Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/mycila/) or [open a new tracker](http://code.google.com/p/mycila/issues/list)

Thank you !
