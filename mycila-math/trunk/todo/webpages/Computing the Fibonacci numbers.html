<p> This page is really about how to tell a computer what to do <em>in such a
way that it goes about it efficiently</em>; so it has to involve some
mathematics (so that we can work out <em>how much work</em> the computer has to
do to complete the computation), so it may as well address an entirely
mathematical problem. </p>

<p> Fibonacci's sequence is defined by: </p><ul>
 <li> f(1) = 1 = f(2)</li>
 <li> f(i+2) = f(i+1) + f(i)</li>

</ul><p> Formally, this only specifies f(i) in so far as i is a whole number
(i.e. one with no fractional part); but it does specify f(i) for every whole
number.  We can work forwards to see that f(3) = 2, f(4) = 3, f(5) = 5, f(6) =
8, f(7) = 13, f(8) = 21 and so on.  We can turn the second rule around to say
f(i) = f(i+2) &#8722;f(i+1) and work backwards to get f(0) = 0, f(&#8722;1) = 1,
f(&#8722;2) = &#8722;1, f(&#8722;3) = 2, f(&#8722;4) = &#8722;3, f(&#8722;5) =
5, f(&#8722;6) = &#8722;8 and so on.  None of this gives us any clue as to the
value of f at f(1/2) or f(&#960;), so Fibonacci's specification only tells us f's
values at whole numbers (positive, zero and negative; collectively known as
integers). </p>

<p> Notice that f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1 would work as an entirely adequate
replacement for the first rule.  Also, observe that f(&#8722;odd) = f(odd) but
f(&#8722;even) = &#8722;f(even) for each odd or even input explored above.  If
we suppose this to be true for each even or odd j &lt; i, for some positive
whole number i (e.g., we've already shown this for i = 7), we can induce that:
</p><dl class="derivation">

 <dt>if i is even</dt>
 <dd>f(&#8722;i) = f(2&#8722;i) &#8722;f(1&#8722;i)</dd>
 <dd><p> but i is even, so 2&#8722;i is also even and 1&#8722;i is odd, so </p></dd>
 <dd>f(&#8722;i) = &#8722;f(i&#8722;2) &#8722;f(i&#8722;1) = &#8722;f(i)</dd>
 <dt>otherwise, i is odd, yielding</dt>
 <dd>f(&#8722;i) = f(2&#8722;i) &#8722;f(1&#8722;i)</dd>
 <dd><p> with i odd, so 2&#8722;i is odd and 1&#8722;i is even, whence </p></dd>
 <dd>f(&#8722;i) = f(i&#8722;2) +f(i&#8722;1) = f(i)</dd>

</dl><p> so the rule we supposed to hold for j &lt; i also holds for j = i;
hence for each j &lt; i+1, whence for j = i+1 and so on; hence for all j.  We
can exploit this to simplify our computations. </p>

<p> I can use some simple theory to work out that any f satisfying the second
rule (ignoring, for the moment, the first) must be a sum of terms, each of which
is of form f(i) = k.power(i, q) with k arbitrary and q.q = q +1 &#8211; which
implies that (2.q&#8722;1).(2.q&#8722;1) = 4.q.q &#8722;4.q +1 = 4.(q +1)
&#8722;4.q +1 = 5, whence 2.q = 1 ±&#8730;5 &#8211; so that our actual f
must be f(i) = k.power(i, (1+&#8730;5)/2) +h.power(i, (1&#8722;&#8730;5)/2) for
some k and h.  We could apply the first rule to work out k and h; but it's
easier to apply f(0) = 0 to infer k+h=0 and then use f(1) = 1 to infer 1 =
k.((1+&#8730;5)/2 +(1&#8722;&#8730;5)/2) = k, so that f(i) = power(i,
(1+&#8730;5)/2) &#8722;power(i, (1&#8722;&#8730;5)/2).  If I'm happy with the
precision of <q>floating point arithmetic</q> this lets me compute f very
efficiently; however, floating point arithmetic is all about adequate
approximations and tends to produce mildly embarrasing results like 4 ×
0.035 = 0.14000000000000001 (when it's easy to see that the right answer is 0.14
exactly).  The first rule gives f(1) and f(2) as whole numbers (they're both 1,
which is as obviously whole as a number can be) and the second rule gives any
other f value by adding or subtracting f values for inputs closer to 1 and 2
than the new one we're obtaining, we can safely infer that all f values are
whole numbers, with no fractional part; which makes it silly to compute them via
<q>floating point numbers</q> (i.e. ones with a fractional part).  So I'll be
looking at how we can compute f's values <em>precisely</em> and ignore the
short-cut via this nice piece of theory.  None the less, notice that the value
of f(i) grows exponentially with i's magnitude. </p>

<p> For this page's purposes, I'm going to use <a href="http://www.python.org/">python</a> as the programming language in my
examples: however, the reader is welcome to read the code as <q>pseudo-code</q>,
understanding indented lines as being subordinates controlled by the last
less-indented line.  The key-word <tt>def</tt> begins the definition of a
function. </p>

<h2>The really obvious way</h2>

<p> Most modern programming languages (for these purposes, ForTran isn't modern)
allow one to write functions which call themselves; this is called
<em>recursion</em>.  A language can be clever enough to dodge the problem I'm
about to point out, but it's instructive to see why simple-minded languages run
into problems with the <q>obvious</q> way to implement Fibonacci's sequence.  We
see how it was originally specified, so we can write ourselves a function:
</p><pre>
def Fibspec(i):
	if i == 1 or i == 2: return 1
	if i &gt; 1: return Fibspec(i-2) +Fibspec(i-1)
	return Fibspec(i+2) -Fibspec(i+1)

</pre><p> This simply states the rules given above: the first rule is the first
line, f(1) = f(2) = 1 (the <code>==</code> operator <em>tests</em> for equality,
as distinct from the <code>=</code> operator, assignment, which causes its left
operand to have the same value as its right operand previously had). </p>

<p> Unless the programming language you're using is very clever, it's going to
do an awful lot of computation, if you use a definition like this.  Let me
explain why.  First, observe that if I ask for Fibspec(1) or Fibspec(2), I get
my answer back immediately: it's 1.  Thus far, Fibspec is doing well.  Next, if
I ask for Fibspec(3) it'll test that 3 isn't 1 or 2, notice that 3 &gt; 1 and
proceed to work out (as its answer) Fibspec(1) +Fibspec(2) &#8211; each of which
it works out directly; so (aside from some over-head, which I'll ignore, in how
the language lets a function call itself recursively) it has to do one addition
to get the answer 2.  If I ask for Fibspec(4), it'll likewise do one addition to
combine Fibspec(2) with Fibspec(3); computing the latter costs it one addition,
as before, so it costs two additions to get the answer Fibspec(4) = 3.  Notice
that the number of additions we've needed to do, each time, is just one less
than the answer we obtained.  For Fibspec(5), we work out the previous, costing
us 2 +1 additions, and do one more addition, getting the answer 5 for 4
additions.  Again, the number of additions is only one less than the answer.
</p>

<p> In fact, if we can compute f(i) and f(i+1) at a cost of one addition less
than their respective values, then computing f(1+2) costs us one addition to add
them together plus f(i)&#8722;1 to compute f(i) and f(i+1)&#8722;1 to compute
f(i+1); for a total of 1 +f(i)&#8722;1 +f(i+1)&#8722;1 = f(i) +f(i+1) &#8722;1 =
f(i+2)&#8722;1 &#8211; so the number of additions we have to do to compute
Fibspec(i) is going to be only one less than the answer we get.  It shouldn't be
hard to see that similar applies for i &lt; 1; computing Fibspec(i) requires
slightly more (rather than less) additions than the magnitude of the answer, in
this case.  Given that this answer grows exponentially with the magnitude of i,
this means that Fibspec is a horribly expensive way to compute the Fibonacci
numbers. </p>

<h2>The obviously better way</h2>

<p> So let's look for a better way to compute f(i).  If you look at what we were
doing before, you should be able to see that the real problem is that, when
computing f(i+2), we first compute f(i), then compute f(i+1); but, in the course
of doing the latter, we <em>re-compute</em> f(i).  That's obviously dumb: if
we'd just remembered it from before, we could save that extra computation.
Since the same applies at each step back towards 1 and 2, we're clearly better
off simply working forwards: </p><pre>
def Fibiter(i):
	if -1 &lt; i &lt; 1: return 0
	old = 0
	ans = 1
	while i &gt; 1:
		new = ans + old
		old = ans
		ans = new
		i = i - 1

	while i &lt; -1:
		new = old - ans
		old = ans
		ans = new
		i = i+1

	return ans

</pre><p> This time, we're just keeping track of two values &#8211; initially
old = f(0) and ans = f(1), which is also f(&#8722;1) &#8211; and working our way
up or down to i one step at a time, so it should be clear that the number of
additions we have to do and the number of subtractions we have to do are, each,
equal to the magnitude of i, give or take one.  Notice, also, that I've thrown
in a piece of robustness for the computation: if i isn't a whole number, the
function shall still return an answer (rather than, say, spinning forever in a
loop that's been confused by an unexpected value); and that answer is something
reasonably similar to the answer you would have had if you'd called Fibiter with
the whole number nearest to i. </p>

<p> So, with a little easy thinking, we've now got a way to compute f(i) at cost
proportional to i rather than proportional to f(i); given that the latter grows
much faster than i, this is clearly an improvement. </p>

<p> The interested reader would do well to think for a while about how it might
be possible to do even better than this. </p>

<h2>The deviously clever way</h2>

<p> Some clever person <a href="http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/hakmem.html">noticed (many years
ago)</a> something marvelously subtle that we can exploit.  However, before I
can explain how <em>that</em> works, I need to introduce you to the efficient
way to compute powers, given a multiplication. </p>

<p> While you can compute a power by repeated multiplication </p><pre>
def powiter(n, x):
	if n &lt; 0: return powiter(-n, 1./x)
	ans = 1
	while n &gt; 0:
		ans = ans * x
		n = n - 1
	return ans

</pre><p> (in which the number of multiplications or divisions we do (and,
incidentally, the number of additions or subtractions we do) is equal to the
power we're raising to) there's a much more efficient way to do it, in which the
number of multiplications we do is just the number of digits it takes to write
out n (that is, the logarithm of n to base two).  Once you understand that, I'll
be able to show you how to compute Fibonacci more efficiently. </p>

<h3>Efficient power</h3><pre>
def powbits(n, x):
	if n &lt; 0: return powbits(-n, 1./x)
	ans = 1
	while n &gt; 0:
		if n % 2: # n is odd
			ans = ans * x
			n = n - 1
		n = n / 2
		x = x * x
	return ans

</pre><p> I encourage the interested reader to think about why this is correct
before reading on.  The % operator computes a remainder: p &#8722; (p % q) is
always a multiple of q; so n % 2 is one (which <code>if</code> considers to be
true) when n is odd and zero (which <code>if</code> considers false) when n is
even. </p>

<p> What <code>powbits</code> does is to express <code>n</code> in binary and
multiply <code>ans</code> by power(power(i, 2), x) if one of the non-zero digits
in n corresponds to power(i, 2).  To help you understand how powbits works,
consider this recursive form of it: </p><pre>
def powrecurse(n, x):
	if n &lt; 0: return powrecurse(-n, 1./x)
	if n % 2: return x * powrecurse((n -1) / 2, x * x)
	if n &gt; 0: return powrecurse(n / 2, x * x)
	return 1

</pre><p> The first line hasn't changed.  If n is zero, we'll fall all the way
through to the end and get 1, which is just power(n, x) with n = 0.  If n is
even and positive, we get to the last but one line: power(n, x) is, in this
case, just power(n/2, x*x), so that's what we return.  For positive odd n, n-1
is even, so power(n-1, x) is just power((n-1)/2, x*x) and multiplying it by x
yields power(n, x).  So I hope you can see that powrecurse does compute power(n,
x). </p>

<p> In a really clever programming language, powrecurse might even be compiled
efficiently: but most imperative languages aren't that clever, so let's see why
powbits is doing the same thing as powerecurse.  Each time we go round the loop
in powbits is equivalent to one layer of recursion in our call to powrecurse:
the first time round the loop, we have our original x; if n is odd, we multiply
ans up by x and leave the subsequent iterations to multiply ans by pow((n-1)/2,
x*x); otherwise, we simply leave those subsequent iterations to multiply ans by
pow(n/2, x*x).  By the time we've fallen off the end of the loop, we've worked
out what we were originally asked for, but we've only gone round the loop once
per binary digit of n (and we've done it without relying on our language to be
clever enough to implement tail recursion with an accumulator). </p>

<h3>Fast Fibonacci</h3>

<p> Now, let's do a piece of seemingly arbitrary algebra: let's introduce a
<q>multiplication</q> on pairs of numbers.  If we have a pair (A, B) and a pair
(C, D), this <q>multiplication</q> combines them to yield the pair (A.C +A.D
+B.C, A.C +B.D). </p>

<p class="aside"> This may well seem odd and arbitrary; but we can interpret it
via polynomials, as follows.  If we read (A, B) as the polynomial (: A.x +B
&#8592;x :), whence likewise (C, D) as (: C.x +D &#8592;x :), the usual
multiplication on polynomials combines these to yield (: A.C.x.x +(A.D +B.C).x
+B.D &#8592;x :).  Earlier, we saw that our solutions are obtained by adding
together geometric series whose factors, q, satisfy q.q = q +1; if we reduce our
result of multiplication via this equality, with x in place of q, we get (: (A.D
+B.C +A.C).x +(B.D +A.C) &#8592;x :), which is exactly the polynomial described
by the pair our <q>multiplication</q> produced.  The interested reader is
encouraged to explore why that causes the following to work. </p>

<p> Now, if we <q>multiply</q> (f(i+1), f(i)) by (1, 0), we get (f(i+1) +f(i),
f(i+1)) = (f(i+2), f(i+1)); thus repeated <q>multiplication</q> performs our
Fibonacci calculation for us, in the same manner as the previous section's
solution to the problem.  However, repeated multiplication, always by the same
factor, should be familiar as multiplying by a power of that factor.  Which
we now know how to do rather efficiently.  So first we define </p><pre>
def fibtimes((a,b), (c,d)):
	return a * (c + d) + b * c, a * c + b * d

</pre><p> which is just our peculiar multiplication; then we implement the
<q>power</q> operation for this <q>multiplication</q> (exploiting the fact that
(A, B) times (0, 1) is just (A, B), so (0, 1) serves as an identity for our
multiplication) restricted to only computing powers of (1, 0), as </p><pre>
def Fibpow(i):
	(a, b) = (1, 0) # x
	(c, d) = (0, 1) # ans
	while i &gt; 0:
		n = i % 2
		if n:
			c, d = fibtimes((a,b),(c,d))
			i = i - 1
		i = i / 2
		(a, b) = fibtimes((a,b), (a,b))
	return (c, d) # x**i

</pre><p> Then we can compute (C, D) = Fibpow(n) to obtain C as f(n) for
positive n; and use the even/odd sign games above to work out the answer for
negative n.  Since we've now reduced our computation to an analogue of power,
the amount of computation needed to compute f(i) only grows, with i, as fast as
the number of digits it takes to write i out in binary (i.e. the logarithm of i
to base two), which grows much less rapidly than i.  We <em>are</em> doing
rather more computation at each of these fewer steps (rather than just one
addition, we're doing: either four multplications, three additions and some easy
binary stuff (taking remainder by two and dividing by two is really cheap); or
eight multiplications, six additions, one subtraction and the cheap binary
stuff), so the Fibiter solution is faster for small values of i; but the Fibpow
solution wins for larger values of i.  If you're always computing answers for
small values of i, and doing so often enough that you care about performance,
Fibiter is easily beaten by an implementation which remembers the answers it's
worked out in the past; which can be just as efficiently implemented using a
variant of Fibspec which caches its answers as by using Fibiter. </p>
