The ancient Egyptians only used fractions of the form <sup>1</sup>/<sub>n</sub>
so any other fraction had to be represented as a <i>sum of such unit fractions</i>
and, furthermore, all the unit fractions were different! <br>
Why?  Is this a better system than our present day one?  In fact, it <i>is</i> for
some tasks.  <p>
This page explores some of the history and gives you a summary of computer searches
for such representations.  There's lots of investigations to do in this area of
maths suitable for 8-10 year olds as well as older students and it is also designed
as a resource for teachers and educators.

Some of the oldest writing in the world is on a form of paper made from papyrus reeds
that grew all along the Nile river in Egypt.  
<a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/%7Edjoyce/mathhist/egypt.html">
  <img src="Egyptian%20Fractions_files/egypt.gif" alt="map of upper Nile" align="left"></a>
[The image is a link to 
<a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/%7Edjoyce/mathhist/mathhist.html">
   David Joyce's site</a>
    on the History of Maths at Clarke University.]

The reeds were squashed and pressed into 
long sheets like a roll of wall-paper and left to dry in the sun.  When dry, these scrolls
 could be rolled up and easily carried or stored.  <p>
 
Some of the papyrus scrolls  date back to about 2000 BC,
around the time of the construction of the larger Egyptian pyramids.  Because there are deserts 
on either side of the Nile,  papyrus scrolls 
have been  well preserved in the dry conditions.</p><p>

  So what was on them do you think?  How to preserve a body
  as a mummy?   Maybe it was
  how to construct the extensive system of canals used for irrigation
  across Egypt or on storage of grain in their great storage
  granaries? Perhaps they tell  how to build
  boats  out of papyrus reeds which float very well because pictures of
  these boats have been found in many Egyptian tombs?<br>
  The surprising answer is that the oldest ones are about <i>mathematics!</i>
  <br clear="all">
  
  
<a name="rhind"></a>
</p><h2 align="center">  Henry Rhind and his Papyrus scroll
</h2>

One of the papyrus scrolls, discovered in a tomb in Thebes, 
was bought by a 25 year old Scotsman, 
Henry Rhind  at a market in
Luxor, Egypt, in 1858. 
After his death at the  age of 30, 
the scroll found its way to the British Museum in London
in 1864 and remained there ever since, being referred to as
the <b>Rhind Mathematical Papyrus</b> (or RMP for short).  <p>
<a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Ahmes.html">
  <img src="Egyptian%20Fractions_files/Rhind_papyrus.jpeg" alt="Rhind papyrus" align="right"> </a>
So what did it say?  </p><p>
The hieroglyphs (picture-writing) on the papyrus were only deciphered in 1842 
(and the Babylonian clay-tablet
cuneiform writing was deciphered later that century).</p><p>

It starts off by saying that the scribe "Ahmes" is writing it about 1600 BC but that
he had copied it from "ancient writings" so it probably goes back to at least
2000BC and probably further.  The picture is also a link so click on it
to go to the St Andrews MacTutor biography of Ahmes.

</p><p>

  Since early civilisations would need to predict the start of spring accurately
  in order to sow seeds, then a large part of such mathematical writing has
  applications in astronomy.  
  Also, calculations were needed for surveying (geometry) and
  for building and for accounting.  However, quite a lot of the problems in the
  RMP are arithmetic puzzles - problems posed just for the fun of solving them!
</p><p>
  On this page we will look at how the Egyptians of 4000 years ago worked with
  fractions.

<h1>      Egyptian Fractions
</h1>

The Egyptians of 3000 BC had an interesting way to represent fractions.<br>
Although they had a notation for <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>
and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> and so on (these are called <b>reciprocals</b> or 
<b>unit fractions</b>
 since they are
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>n</sub> for some number n), their notation did not allow them to write
<sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub> or <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> or <sup>4</sup>/<sub>7</sub> as we would today.<p>
Instead, they were able to write <i>any</i> fraction as <b><i>a sum of unit fractions</i></b>
where <b>all the unit fractions were different</b>.

</p><p>
For example,</p><div align="center">
<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>  <p>
<sup>6</sup>/<sub>7</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>42</sub>
</p></div>
<br>

<i>A fraction written as a sum of distinct unit fractions</i> is called an <i><b>Egyptian Fraction</b></i>.


<a name="why"></a>
<h2>           Why use Egyptian fractions today?
</h2>

For two very good reasons:

<ul>
<li> The first reason is a  practical one. <br>
     Suppose you have  5 sacks of grain to share 
     between 8 people, so each would receive <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of a sack of grain
     in terms of present-day fractions.  
     How are you going to do it simply, without using a calculator?
     You could try pouring the 5 sacks of grain into 8 heaps and, by carefully comparing them,
     perhaps by weighing them against each other,  balance them so they are all
     the same!  But is there a better way?  We will see that using unit fractions makes this easier.
     
</li><li> The second reason is that it is much easier to <i>compare fractions</i> using Egyptian 
     fractions than 
     it is by using our present-day notation for fractions!  
     For instance: 
      <div align="center">
               Which is bigger:  
              <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub>  or  <sup>4</sup>/<sub>7</sub>?
     </div>
     but remember - you are <i>not</i> allowed to use your calculator to answer this!  Again unit fractions can 
     make this much simpler.
     
</li></ul>

On this page we see how both of these work in Egyptian fractions.

<a name="practical"></a>

<h2>           A practical use of Egyptian Fractions
</h2>

So suppose Fatima has 5 loaves of bread to share among the 8 workers who have helped dig 
her fields this week and clear the irrigation channels.  
<i>Pause for a minute and decide how YOU would solve this problem before reading on.....</i>
<p>

First Fatima sees that they all get at least half a loaf, so she gives all 
8 of them half a loaf each, with one whole loaf left.<br>
Now it is easy to divide one loaf into 8, so they get an extra eighth of a loaf each 
and all the loaves are divided equally between the 5 workers. On the picture
here they each receive one red part 
(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> a loaf) and one green part (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of a loaf):
             <img src="Egyptian%20Fractions_files/egypt5.gif" alt="4 loaves split into halves and 1 split into eighths" align="left" height="64" width="238"> </p><p>  
  and   
  <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>
<br clear="all">

      <ol class="ttd"> 
       <li>  Suppose Fatima had 3 loaves to share between 4 people.  
            How would she do it?</li>
       <li> ...and what if it was 2 loaves amongst 5 people?</li>
       <li> ...or 4 loaves between 5 people?</li>
       <li>  What about 13 loaves to share among 12 people?  
             We could give them one loaf each and
            divide the 13<sup>th</sup> into 13 parts for the final portion to 
            give to everyone.<br>
           Try representing <sup>13</sup>/<sub>12</sub> as 
           <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>*</sub> .
           What does this mean - that is, how would you  divide the loaves using this 
           representation?  <br>
           Was this easier?</li>

 <h2>                   Comparing Egyptian fractions 
 </h2>
 
 
 
 Which is larger:  <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>  or  <sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub>?
 <p>
 We <i>could use decimals</i>  so that <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> =0.75 =<sup>75</sup>/<sub>100</sub> whereas
 <sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub>  =0.8 = 0.80 = <sup>80</sup>/<sub>100</sub> so we can see that 80 (hundredths)
 is bigger than 75 and we can now see that
  <b><sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> is bigger than <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></b>.
  
 </p><p>Could you do this without converting to decimals?<br>
 We could try using ordinary fractions as follows:<br>
 
        What common fraction could we convert both <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>  
        and   <sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> into?   
        20<sup>th</sup>s would do:<br>
        <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> = <sup>15</sup>/<sub>20</sub>  whereas<br>
        <sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> = <sup>16</sup>/<sub>20</sub><br>
        so again we can easily see that <sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> is larger 
        than <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>.
        
 </p><p>  Using Egyptian fractions we write each as a sum of unit fractions:
 <br>
 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>     <br>
 <sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + 
                             <sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub>
 and, expanding <sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub> as <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub>
 we have<br>
 <sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>  + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub> <br>
 We can now see that <sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> is the larger - by exactly 
 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub>.

<h1>            Different representations for the same fraction

We have already seen that 
    <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + 
                                <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>       <br>
    Can you write <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> as <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + 
    <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>*</sub> ?
    <br>
    What about <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> as <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>*</sub> ?
    <br>
    How many more can you find?
 
 <p>
 Here are some results that mathematicians have proved:
 </p><ul>
 <li> Every fraction <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub> can be written as a sum of
      unit fractions...
 </li><li> .. and each can be written in an infinite number of such ways!
 </li></ul>
 
 Now let's examine each of these in turn and I'll try to convince you that each 
 is true for all fractions <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub> less than one 
 (so that T, the number on top, is smaller than B, the bottom number).  
 <p>
 You can <a href="#smallshort">skip over these two sub-sections</a> if you like.
 
 <a name="infnbways"></a>
 </p><h2>               Each fraction has an infinite number of Egyptian fraction forms
 </h2>
 
 To see why the second fact is true, consider this:
 
 <div class="rule">
 1 = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> + 
                                 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub>   (*)
 </div>
 
 So if <br>
 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>       <br>
Let's use (*) to <i>expand</i> the final fraction <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>:<br>
So let's divide  equation (*) by 4:
 
 <div align="center">
         <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> + 
                                     <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub> + 
                                     <sup>1</sup>/<sub>24</sub>
 </div>
 
  which we can then feed back into our Egyptian fraction for 
  <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>:<br>
  
 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>    <br>
 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub> + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>24</sub>    <br>
 
 But now we can do the same thing for the final fraction here, dividing equation (*) by 24 this time.
 Since we are choosing the largest denominator to
expand, it will be replaced by even larger ones so we won't repeat any denominators that we
have used already:
 
 <div align="center">
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>24</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>48</sub> + 
                                   <sup>1</sup>/<sub>72</sub> + 
                                   <sup>1</sup>/<sub>144</sub>
 </div>
 and so
 <br>
 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub> + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>48</sub> + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>72</sub> + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>144</sub>
 <br>
 Now we can repeat the process by again expanding the last term: 
 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>144</sub>
 and so on for ever!<br>
 
 Each time we get a different set of unit fractions which add to 
 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>!
 <br>
 
 This shows conclusively once we have found one way of writing 
 <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>
 as a sum of unit fractions, then we can derive as many other representations as
 we wish!  If T=1 already (so we have <sup>1</sup>/<sub>B</sub>) then using (*) we can always start off the process 
  by dividing (*) by B to get an initial 3 unit fractions that sum to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>B</sub>.

 <a href="http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/" target="_blank">Fibonacci Numbers</a>.
 
 <p> Remember that </p><ul>
 <li> <b><sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>&lt;1</b> and 
 </li><li> if T=1 the problem is solved since <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub> is already a unit fraction, so 
 </li><li> we are interested in those fractions where <b>T&gt;1</b>.
 </li></ul>
 <p>
 The method is to find the <b>biggest unit fraction we can and take it from 
 <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub></b> and hence its other name - the <b>greedy algorithm</b>.<br>
 With what is left, we repeat the process.  We will
 show that this series of unit fractions always decreases, never repeats a fraction
 and eventually will stop.  Such processes are now called <i>algorithms</i>
 and this is an example of a <i>greedy algorithm</i> since we (greedily) take
 the largest unit fraction we can and then repeat on the remainder.
 
 </p><p>
 Let's look at an example before we present the proof: <sup>521</sup>/<sub>1050</sub>.<br>
 
 <sup>521</sup>/<sub>1050</sub> is less than one-half (since 521 is less than a half of 1050)
 but it is bigger than one-third.  So the largest unit fraction we can take away from 
 <sup>521</sup>/<sub>1050</sub> is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>:
 </p><div align="center">
      <sup>521</sup>/<sub>1050</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> + R
 </div>
 What is the remainder?
 <div align="center">
    <sup>521</sup>/<sub>1050</sub> - <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> 
    = <sup>57</sup>/<sub>350</sub>
 </div>
 So we repeat the process on <sup>57</sup>/<sub>350</sub>:<br>
 This time the largest unit fraction less than <sup>57</sup>/<sub>350</sub> is
 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub> and the remainder is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>.<br>
 <blockquote>How do we know it is 7?  Divide the bottom (larger) number, 350,  by the top
 one, 57, and we get 6.14... . So we need a number larger than 6 (since we have 6 + 0.14)
 and the next one above 6 is 7.)</blockquote>
 
 So
 <div align="center">
    <sup>521</sup>/<sub>1050</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> +
           <sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>
 </div>
 
 The sequence of remainders is important in the proof that we do not have to keep
 on doing this for ever for some fractions <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>:
 <div align="center">
      <sup>521</sup>/<sub>1050</sub>, 
      <sup>57</sup>/<sub>350</sub>, 
      <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>
 </div>
 in particular, although the <i>denominators</i> of the remainders are getting bigger,
 the important fact that is true in <i>all cases</i> is that 
 <i>the numerator of the remainder is getting smaller</i>.   If it keeps decreasing then it must
 eventually reach 1 and the process stops.
 <p>
 
 Practice with these examples and then we'll have a look at finding <i>short</i> Egyptian fractions.

 </h2>
 You can <a href="#greedyshort">skip over this proof</a> if you like.<p>
 
 Now let's see how we can show this is true for all fractions <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>.
 
 We want
 </p><div align="center">
 <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>u<sub>1</sub></sub> +
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>u<sub>2</sub></sub> +
                             ... +
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>u<sub>n</sub></sub><br>
  where  u<sub>1</sub> &lt; u<sub>2</sub> &lt; ... &lt; u<sub>n</sub>
  </div>
  Also, we are choosing the largest u<sub>1</sub> at each stage.<br>
  
  What does this mean?<br>
  It means that 
  <div align="center">
       <sup>1</sup>/<sub>u<sub>1</sub></sub> &lt; <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>
  </div>
  but that <sup>1</sup>/<sub>u<sub>1</sub></sub> is the <i> largest</i> 
  such fraction. For instance, we found that
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> was the largest unit fraction less than
  <sup>521</sup>/<sub>1050</sub>.  This means that 
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> would be <i>bigger</i> than <sup>521</sup>/<sub>1050</sub>.
  <br>
  In general, if  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>u<sub>1</sub></sub> is the largest unit fraction
  less than <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub> then 
  <div align="center">
        <sup>1</sup>/<sub>u<sub>1</sub>-1</sub>  &gt; <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>
  </div>
  
  Since T&gt;1, neither <sup>1</sup>/<sub>u<sub>1</sub></sub> nor 
                     <sup>1</sup>/<sub>u<sub>1</sub>-1</sub>
                      equal <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>.
  
  <p>
  
  <b>What is the remainder?</b>
  
   </p><p> It is 
   </p><div align="center">
   <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub> - <sup>1</sup>/<sub>u<sub>1</sub></sub>
   = <sup>(T*u<sub>1</sub> - B)</sup>/<sub>(B*u<sub>1</sub>)</sub>
   </div>
   
   Also, since 
   <div align="center">
        <sup>1</sup>/<sub>(u<sub>1</sub>-1)</sub>  &gt; <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>
  </div>
  then multiplying both sides by B we have
  <div align="center">
        B/<sub>(u<sub>1</sub>-1)</sub>  &gt; T
  </div>
 or, multiplying both sides by (u<sub>1</sub>-1) and expanding the brackets,
 then adding T and subtracting B to both sides we have:
   <div align="center">
       B  &gt; T*(u<sub>1</sub> - 1)<br>
       B  &gt; T*u<sub>1</sub> - T<br>
       T  &gt; T*u<sub>1</sub> - B
   </div>
   Now T*u<sub>1</sub> - B was the <i>numerator of the remainder</i>
   and we have just shown that <i>it is smaller than the original numerator T</i>.
   If the remainder, in its lowest terms, has a 1 on the top, we are finished.
   Otherwise, we can <i>repeat the process</i> on the remainder, which has a smaller
   denominator and so the remainder when we take off its largest unit fraction gets
   smaller still.  Since T is a whole (positive) number, this process <i>must</i>
   inevitably  terminate with a numerator of 1 at some stage.
 
 
 <p>
 That completes the proof that
 </p><ul>
 <li> There is always a <i>finite</i> list of unit fractions whose sum is any given
    fraction <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>
 </li><li> We can find such a sum by taking the largest unit fraction at each stage and
      repeating on the remainder (the <i>greedy algorithm</i>)
 </li><li> The unit fractions so chosen get smaller and smaller (and so all are  unique)
 </li></ul>
 <p>
 
 
 

 So let's now concentrate on the <i><b>shortest</b> Egyptian fractions </i>
 for any given fraction.

  <a name="greedyshort"></a>
 <h2> The <i>greedy method</i> and the <i>shortest</i> Egyptian fraction
 </h2>
 
 However, the Egyptian fraction produced by the greedy method may not be the shortest
 such fraction.  Here is an example:
 <br>
 by the greedy method,  <sup>4</sup>/<sub>17</sub> reduces to
 <div align="center">
 <sup>4</sup>/<sub>17</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> +
                              <sup>1</sup>/<sub>29</sub> +
                              <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1233</sub> +
                              <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3039345</sub>
 </div>
 whereas we can also check that
 <div align="center">
 <sup>4</sup>/<sub>17</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> +
                              <sup>1</sup>/<sub>30</sub> +
                              <sup>1</sup>/<sub>510</sub>
 </div>
 
  
<p> Here is the complete list of all the <i>shortest</i> representations of <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>
for B up to 11.  We use a <i>list notation</i> here to make the unit fractions
more readable.  For instance, above we saw that:

</p><div align="center">
<sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> + 
                             <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub>
</div>
which we will write as:

<h2>           Finding patterns for shortest Egyptian Fractions

There seem to be lots of patterns to spot in the table above.<br>
The top row, for instance, seems to have the pattern that <sup>2</sup>/<sub>B</sub> can be written as a
sum of just 2 unit fractions (providing that B is odd since otherwise, <sup>2</sup>/<sub>B</sub> would not
be in its "lowest form").  
The odd numbers are those of the form 2i+1 as i goes from 1 upwards.

Let's concentrate on the first sum on each line since some of the fractions
above have more than one form as a sum of two unit fractions.

It looks as if

</div>
Can you spot how we can use (2i+1) and i to find the missing number?<br>
Here is the table again with the (2i+1) and i+1 parts in <span class="red">red</span>

</div>

Yes! Just multiply the red numbers i+1 and 2i+1 to get the green ones!<br>

<br>
So it looks like we may have the pattern:
<div align="center">
         <sup>2</sup>/<sub>2i+1</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>i+1</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>(i+1)(2i+1)</sub>
</div>

We can check it by simplifying the fraction on the right and seeing if it reduces to
the one on the left:
<pre>                     1/(i+1) + 1/[(i+1)(2i+1)]
                   = (2i+1  + 1)/[(i+1)(2i+1)]
                   = (2i+2)/[(i+1)(2i+1)]
                   = 2(i+1)/[(i+1)(2i+1)]
                   = 2/(2i+1)   which is the fraction we wanted!!
</pre>
So algebra has shown us that the formula is <i>always true</i>.


<a name="nbshort"></a>
<h2> How many Egyptian Fractions of shortest length are there for <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>?
</h2>

Here is a table like the one above, but this time each entry is a <b>count</b>
of all the ways we can write <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub> as a sum of the <b>minimum</b> number of unit fractions:

<br>
For instance, we have seen that <sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> can be written with a minimum of 2 unit fractions,
so <b>2</b> appears in the first table under <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>=<sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub>.<br> 
But we saw that <sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> has <i>two ways</i> in which it can be so written, so in the
following table we have entry 2 under <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>=<sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub>.<br>
<sup>2</sup>/<sub>15</sub> needs at least 2 unit fractions in its Egyptian form:  here are all the
variations:
<div align="center">
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><sup>2</sup>/<sub>15</sub></td><td> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>120</sub> </td></tr>
<tr><td>  </td><td>   = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>45</sub> </td></tr>
<tr><td>  </td><td>   = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>30</sub> </td></tr>
<tr><td>  </td><td>   = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub></td></tr>

so it has <i>four</i> representations.  In the table below, under <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub>=<sup>2</sup>/<sub>15</sub> we have

<h1>                               Fixed Length Egyptian Fractions
</h1>
The shortest Egyptian fractions do not always give the smallest numbers.  <br>
For example, the smallest number of unit fractions for <sup>8</sup>/<sub>11</sub> is 4; there are
16 of them and the one with the smallest numbers (i.e. its largest denominator
is the smallest of the 14) is 
8/11 = 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/22 + 1/66<br>
However, if we look for a larger collection, of 5 unit fractions, we find smaller numbers still:
<br>
8/11 = 1/2 + 1/11 + 1/12 + 1/33 + 1/44 and<br>
8/11 = 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/11 + 1/33 + 1/44
<p>

Here we investigate
Egyptian Fractions with more than the smallest number of reciprocals.
<br>
We have <a href="#alwaysef">already seen</a>
that every fraction <sup>T</sup>/<sub>B</sub> has an Egyptian Fraction
and, what is more, <a href="#infnbways">an infinite number of longer and longer
 Egyptian fraction forms</a>.  <br>
 
 So let's see what we can find about the number of 
 Egyptian fractions for <sup>t</sup>/<sub>b</sub> of a given length L.

<li> <a href="#Fibgreedy">Fibonacci's Greedy algorithm</a> 
  to find Egyptian fractions with a sum of 1 is as follows: <br>
  <blockquote>Choose the largest unit fraction we can, write it down and subtract it<br>
    Repeat this  on the remainder until
    we find the remainder is itself a unit fraction not equal to one already written down. <br>
    At this point we could stop or else continue splitting the unit fraction into smaller fractions.
    </blockquote>
     To use this method to find a set of unit fractions that sum to 1:<br>
      So we would start with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> as the largest unit fraction less than 1:<br>
   <blockquote>   1 = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + ( <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>  remaining) </blockquote>
   so we repeat the process on the remainder:
      the largest fraction less than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>  is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>:<blockquote>
      1 = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> + ( <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> remaining). </blockquote>
      We could stop now or else continue with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub> 
      as the largest unit fraction less than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub>
      ...<blockquote>
      1 = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub> + ...</blockquote>
  Find a few more terms, choosing the largest unit fraction at each point rather than stopping. <br>

</p><h1>                      Smallest Denominators
</h1>

Apart from the shortest Egyptian fractions (those with the fewest unit fractions), 
we can also look for the <i>smallest</i> numbers in the denominators.<br>
<a href="#fxdlen">As we saw</a> at the start of the <b>Fixed Length Egyptian Fractions</b> section above, the smallest
denominators do not always appear in the <i>shortest</i> Egyptian fractions.  
<ul>
<li>The <i>shortest</i> for 8/11 is<br>
   8/11 = 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/22 + 1/66<br>
   and 15 others, but this one has the fewest numbers with just 4 unit fractions but it
   includes a denominator of 66;</li>
<li>The EF for 8/11 with <i>smallest numbers</i> has no denominator larger than 44 and there are two 
such EFs both containing 5 unit fractions (out of the 667 of length 5):<br>
8/11 = 1/2 + 1/11 + 1/12 + 1/33 + 1/44 and<br>
8/11 = 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/11 + 1/33 + 1/44
</li>
</ul>
Here is a list of the EF's for 1 of various lengths  with smallest denominators:

So of all the EFs for 1 with 3 fractions, the smallest has all denominators no bigger than <span class="math">6</span>.<br>
Of those EFs for 1 with 4 fractions, the smallest has no denominator bigger than <span class="math">12</span>. 
and for 5 fractions, the smallest has no denominator bigger than <span class="math">15</span>.<br>
The series of these smallest maximum denominators (the <b>minimax</b> solution) in the EFs for 1

</p><h1>                         The <sup>2</sup>/<sub>n</sub> table of the Rhind Papyrus
</h1>
Here is the Table at the start of the Rhind mathematical papyrus. 
It is a table of unit fractions for <sup>2</sup>/<sub>n</sub> for the odd values of n from 3 to 101.<br>
Sometimes the shortest Egyptian fraction is ignored in the table in favour of a longer decomposition.
Only one sum of unit fractions is given when several are possible.
The scribe tends to favour unit fractions with even denominators, since this makes their use in
multiplication and division easier. The Egyptian multiplication method was based on doubling and
adding, in exactly the same way that a binary computer uses today, so it is  easy to double when the
unit fractions are even.<br>
Also, he prefers to use smaller numbers.  Their method of writing numerals was decimal
more like the Roman numerals than our decimal place system though.  He seems to reject
any form that would need a numeral bigger than 999.
All the shortest forms and alternative shortest forms are given here in an extra column.

All those with n  a multiple of 3 follow the same pattern:
<blockquote> <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3n</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2n</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6n</sub>
</blockquote>
But there are still some mysteries here.  <br>
For instance why choose<blockquote>
 <sup>2</sup>/<sub>95</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>60</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>380</sub>  + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>570</sub>  
 </blockquote>instead of the much simpler 
 <blockquote>
 <sup>2</sup>/<sub>95</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>60</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>228</sub>?
</blockquote>
Why stop at 103? 
There is a sum for <sup>2</sup>/<sub>103</sub> with two unit fractions but it contains a four digit number:
  <blockquote>
 <sup>2</sup>/<sub>103</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>52</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5356</sub>
 </blockquote>
and all of the other 65 of length 3  contain a denominator of at least 1236.  <br>
The one with this least maximum denominator is:
 <sup>2</sup>/<sub>103</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>60</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>515</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1236</sub><br>
There are only two of length 4 that don't use four digit numbers:
<blockquote>
 <sup>2</sup>/<sub>103</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>103</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>206</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>309</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>618</sub><br>
 <sup>2</sup>/<sub>103</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>72</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>309</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>824</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>927</sub>.

David Eppstein</a> of University of California, Irvine
has a host of links on all sorts of information on 
Egyptian Fractions and a comprehensive guide to the different algorithms that can be used
to write your own Egyptian Fraction computer programs, although his are described using many different techniques available in 
the Mathematica package  and there are references to C and C++ sources too.

G Robins, C Shute, British Museum Press, 1987, (88 pages, paperback)
is highly recommended for its explanations of the arithmetic
methods that
may have been used in the 2/n table and the other tables and problems in the papyrus. It has
excellent colour photographs of the papyrus and many illustrations.
