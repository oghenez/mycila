  the Fibonacci Spiral and sea shell shapes, branching plants,

 <h3> The Puzzling World of Fibonacci Numbers
    </h3>

   A pair of pages with plenty of  playful problems  to perplex the
   professional and the part-time puzzler!
<ul class="homel1">
<li>     The <a href="http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibpuzzles.html">        Easier Fibonacci Puzzles page</a>
   <br> has the Fibonacci numbers in brick wall patterns, 
      Fibonacci bee lines, seating people in a row and the Fibonacci numbers
      again, 
     giving change and a game with match sticks and even
     with  electrical resistance and lots more puzzles
     all involve the Fibonacci numbers! 
     </li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibpuzzles2.html">      Harder Fibonacci Puzzles page</a> 
     
    <br> still has problems where
        the Fibonacci numbers are the answers - well, all but ONE, but WHICH one?  
    If you know the Fibonacci Jigsaw puzzle where rearranging the 4 wedge-shaped 
    pieces makes an   additional square appear,
     did you know the <i>same</i> puzzle can be rearranged to make a 
     different shape where a square now <i>disappears</i>?<br>
      For these
        puzzles, I do not know of any simple explanations of <i><b>why</b></i>
        the Fibonacci numbers occur - and <b>that's the 
        real puzzle - can you supply a <b>simple</b> reason why??</b>

</ul>

 

 <h3>     The Intriguing Mathematical World of Fibonacci and Phi
 </h3>
 The golden section numbers are also written  using the Greek letters Phi 
 <img src="Fibonacci%20Numbers_files/phi.gif" alt="Phi" height="15" width="11"> and phi

       try out the simple Fibonacci numbers trick!<br>
       The following pages give you lots of opportunities to

    <h3 class="homelt">            The Golden Section 
    </h3>
    
The golden section number is closely connected with the Fibonacci 
series and has a value of 
 (<img src="Fibonacci%20Numbers_files/sqrt.gif" alt="sqrt" height="13" width="8">5 + 1)/2 or:

<!--phiHR--><p class="nbHR" align="center">161803 39887 49894 84820 45868 34365 63811 77203 09179 80576 ..<a href="http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/phi.html#phi2000">More</a>.. <a href="http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibCalcX.html"><img src="Fibonacci%20Numbers_files/calcicon.gif" alt="Calculator" border="0" height="13" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="34"></a></p>

<br>which we call Phi (note the capital <b>P</b>) on these pages.  
The other number also called the golden section
is Phi-1 or 061803... with exactly the same decimal fraction part as Phi.  This value we call phi
(with a small <b>p</b>) here.
  Phi and phi have some interesting and unique properties such as 1/phi 
  is the same as 1+phi=Phi. <br>
  The third of Simon Singh's

was all about <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/5numbers3.shtml">the Golden Ratio</a>.  
It is an excellent introduction to the golden section.  I spoke on

<h3>     The Golden String
</h3>

   The golden string is also called the <i>Infinite Fibonacci Word</i> or the 
     <i>Fibonacci Rabbit sequence</i>.   
    There is another way to look at Fibonacci's Rabbits problem that gives an infinitely
    long sequence of 1s and 0s called the  Golden String:-
    <div align="center"><span style="font-size: larger; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"><b>
       1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1  ...
    </b></span></div><br>
     This string is a closely related to 
    the golden section and the Fibonacci numbers.<br>
  <ul class="homel1">
  <li>    <a href="http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibrab.html"> 
    
                 Fibonacci Rabbit Sequence
                 
    </a><br>
   See show how the golden string arises directly from the Rabbit problem and
   also is used by computers when they compute the Fibonacci numbers.
   
     You can hear the Golden sequence as a sound track too.<br>
     The Fibonacci Rabbit sequence is an example of a <b>fractal</b> - a
     mathematical object that contains the whole of itself within itself
      infinitely many times over.</li>

<h3>    Fibonacci - the Man and His Times 
</h3>

<ul class="homel1">
<li>     <a href="http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibBio.html">
          Who was Fibonacci?
     </a>
     
   <br>
  Here is a  brief biography of Fibonacci and his  historical
  achievements in mathematics, and how he helped Europe replace the
  Roman numeral system with the "algorithms" that we use today.<br>
    Also there is a guide to some memorials
  to Fibonacci to see in Pisa, Italy.

<h3>    More Applications of Fibonacci Numbers and Phi
</h3>

<ul class="homel1">

               The Fibonacci numbers in a formula for Pi
    (<img src="Fibonacci%20Numbers_files/pi.gif" alt=" pi " border="0" height="7" width="9">) </a>

  <br>
    There are several ways to compute pi (314159 26535 ..) accurately.  One 
   that has been used a lot
   is based on a nice formula for calculating which angle has a given tangent, discovered
   by James Gregory.  His formula together with the
   Fibonacci numbers can be used to compute pi.  
   This page introduces you to all these concepts from scratch.</li>

     </a>
          
  <br>
   Sometimes we find series that for quite a few terms look exactly like the 
     Fibonacci numbers, but, when we look a bit more closely, they aren't - they are 
     Fibonacci Forgeries.<br>
    Since we would not be telling the truth if we said they <i>were</i> the
     Fibonacci numbers, perhaps we should call them <b>Fibonacci Fibs</b>

<li>   <a href="http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/lucasNbs.html">  The Lucas Numbers</a>
  <br>
   Here is a series that is very similar to the Fibonacci series, 
    <b>the Lucas series</b>, but it starts with 2 and 1 instead
    of Fibonacci's 0 and 1.  It sometimes pops up in the pages above so here
    we investigate  it some more and discover its properties.<br>
    It ends with a number trick
    which  you can use "to impress your friends with your amazing calculating abilities"
    as the adverts say.  It uses facts about the golden section and its relationship with
    the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers.

<li>  <a href="http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/Fibonomials.html"> The Fibonomials </a> 
  <br>
     The basic relationship defining the Fibonacci numbers is F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n+1) where we use some
     combination of the previous numbers (here, the previous two) to find the next.  Is there such a relationship
     between the <i>squares of the Fibonacci numbers</i> F(n)<sup>2</sup>? or the <i>cubes</i> F(n)<sup>3</sup>? or other
     powers?  Yes there is and it involves a triangular table of numbers with similar properties to Pascal's Triangle and
     the binomial numbers: the Fibonomials.

                              General Fibonacci Series  
</a>
     <br>
     The Lucas numbers change the two starting values of the Fibonacci series from
     0 and 1 to 2 and 1.  What if we changed these to any two values? These General Fibonacci
     series are called the G series but <i>the</i> Fibonacci series and Phi again play
     a prominent role in their mathematical properties.  Also we look at two special 
     arrays (tables) of numbers, the Wythoff array and the Stolarsky array and show how
     a these two collections of general Fibonacci series 
     contain <i>each whole number exactly once</i>.  The secret behind such clever arrays
     is ... the golden section number Phi!

              Fibonacci Numbers and The Golden Section In  Art, Architecture and Music </a>
    
    <br>
    The golden section  has been used in many designs, from  the ancient <b>Parthenon</b> 
    in Athens (400BC) to Stradivari's violins.
    It was known to artists such as <b>Leonardo da Vinci</b>
    and musicians and composers, notably <b>Bartk</b> and <b>Debussy</b>.  
     This is a different kind of page to those above, being concerned with
    speculations about where Fibonacci numbers and the golden section 
    both do and do not occur in art,  architecture and music.  
    All the other pages are factual and verifiable - the material here is a 
    often a matter of opinion.  What do <i>you</i> think?
