/*

Numbers of 2 digits can only be composed with [0..4] since their factorial is below 99
Combinations of 0, 1, 2 and 3 are not valid since to small
The only possibilities are numbers like ?4 and 4? where ? is in [0..4]. As the number contains 4, it will be between 14 (1!+4!=25) and 44 (4!+4!=48)

=> give a try, there is no possibility (14, 24, 34, 44, 43, 42, 41)

So our numbers begins with 3 digits

9! = 362880

So the maximum number we can product with 9! is such that length(N)*9!=N

For 7 digits:  9999999 gives 7*9!=2540160 (7 digits)
For 8 digits: 99999999 gives 8*9!=2903040 (7 digits also !)

Oups ! It means that we cannot produce numbers greater than 7 digits.

The factorion (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Factorion.html) of an n-digit number cannot exceed nÂ·9!. So the maximum to check will be 2540160.
